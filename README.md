# Introduction

This app is built using [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/docs/components-toast--props) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) because I love their HMR

## Requirement

1. node v18
2. yarn v1

## Setup

1. Please go through the following [INSTRUCTION](https://github.com/khoonlin-dev/NestShopServer#readme) to set up the DB and Server.
2. Make sure that the Server is hosted at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. If not, you can go to [This file](./src/state/shopSlice.ts) and change `const API = "http://localhost:3000"` to your desired host
4. Run yarn install and yarn build
5. Run yarn preview. Make sure the server is running, otherwise even though the page is loaded, the "data" field will not show anything

## For time purpose I will add-in the feature section in the future
